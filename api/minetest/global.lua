---* `button` and variants: If pressed, contains the user-facing button text as value. If not pressed, is `nil`
---* `field`, `textarea` and variants: Text in the field

---* `textlist`: See `minetest.explode_textlist_event`
---* `table`: See `minetest.explode_table_event`
---* `scrollbar`: See `minetest.explode_scrollbar_event`
---* Special case: `["quit"]="true"` is sent when the user actively closed the form by mouse click, keypress or through a `button_exit[]` element.
---* Special case: `["key_enter"]="true"` is sent when the user pressed the Enter key and the focus was either nowhere (causing the formspec to be closed) or on a button. If the focus was on a text field, additionally, the index `key_enter_field` contains the name of the text field. See also: `field_close_on_enter`.
